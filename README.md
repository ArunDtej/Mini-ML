Mini Deep Learning framework using jax as backend for weight optimization, supports gradient tracking on custom parameters to empower extendability.
Currently supports Dense Layers, if you want to implement any new nonexisting layers then feel free to make a pull request,
This is soley a learning project that I made out of ethusiaism, so don't expect much. 
It works fine according to my experimentations, so good luck trying it out.
